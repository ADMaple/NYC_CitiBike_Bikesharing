# NYC CitiBike Bikesharing

## Project Overview
This analysis of CitiBike's bikesharing program in NYC is provided as research for a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa, and aims to determine the feasibility of such a business. Looking at data on numbers of bikes, numbers of trips, peak times of travel, types of customers, trip duration, and bike use/lifecycle will be useful in comparing the potential population needs of another program in another city and perhaps identify potential differences in customer use as well as highlight budget requirements.

The inspiration for this business proposal is based on the personal experience of the presenters, who feel their most recent trip to NYC was highly enhanced by the bikesharing business there.

## Resources

Data Source: 201908-citibike-tripdata, dateformat-citibike-tripdata

Software: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau

## Analysis and Results of Data
The number of total trips included in the dataset used for this analysis is 2,344,224 trips. All trips took place in 2019. CitiBike users have the option to be "subscribers" or anonymous users. Gender appears to have been known for all subscribers and bikesharing use specific to gender was therefore also analyzed.
